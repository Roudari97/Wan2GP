I use this as a reasonable default. |\n euler_a: Softer, thinner lines. Can sometimes tend towards a 2.5D look. CFG can be pushed a bit higher than other samplers without burning the image. |\n dpmpp_2m_sde_gpu: similar in style to er_sde but can produce more variety and be more 'creative'. Depending on the prompt it can get too wild sometimes.",
